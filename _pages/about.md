Hi, I’m Enze Shi, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Alberta, supervised by [Prof. Linglong Kong](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkong/) and [Prof. Bei Jiang](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bei1/).  My academic journey started at Xiamen University, where I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computational Mathematics (2020). I then pursued a Master’s degree in Statistics (2022) at the University of Alberta before continuing into my Ph.D. program. I have a broad research interest in the role of statistics in the era of big data and my research focuses on building ethical and trustworthy AI systems, with interests in:

-  Online learning  
-  Fairness assurance and bias mitigation  
-  Privacy preservation for synthetic data and estimates  
-  Functional data analysis & Medical image analysis
-  Generative models
